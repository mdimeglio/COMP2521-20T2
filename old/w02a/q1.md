The following algorithm takes a sorted array A[1..n] of characters, and outputs, in reverse order, all 2-letter words νω such that ν ≤ ω.

Count the number of primitive operations (evaluating an expression, indexing into an array). What is the time complexity of this algorithm in big-O notation?

for all i = n down to 1 do
    for all j = n down to i do
        print A[i] A[j]
    end for
end for
