The following algorithm takes a sorted array A[1..n] of characters, and outputs, in reverse order, all 2-letter words νω such that ν ≤ ω.

Count the number of primitive operations (evaluating an expression, indexing into an array). What is the time complexity of this algorithm in big-O notation?

```
for all i = n down to 1 do
    for all j = n down to i do
        print A[i] A[j]
    end for
end for
```

```
    mov     $i $n
loop1:
    bez     $i end1
    mov     $j $n
loop2:
    blt     $j $i end2
    add     $t $A $i
    print   $t
    print   ' '
    add     $t $A $j
    print   $j
    dec     $j
    j       loop2
end2:
    dec     $i
    j       loop1
end1:
